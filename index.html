	<h1>Welcome to here.</h1>
    <h2>May 26, 2025</h1>
		<p>
			Lately, I've been wanting to make a website for myself.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've always been a lurker in any internet community I join. Over the years, though, I've gradually realized that's really not how I want to carry on. I want to contribute to the spaces I'm in. I want to be part of a community. I want to be online. That said, lurking for years means I don't really have an online home to call my own.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know social media isn't for me- I have no interest in making a profile on Twitter, Reddit, or any other major site. I want a space to express myself, though, and all of my interests. I don't want to limit myself to any specific topic. I want control over my space, and to not need to conform to any specific template. And, at the end of the day, I really want to experiment with web design. I love the retro- and indie- web, and I've dabbled in the long past, but web design is a blind spot for me. I really do  want to write more code to do less.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, I made a website.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right now, this space is one blank page with a single blog entry, but I don't plan to keep it this way forever. I have big ideas, and I want to do something different than I normally do -- I want to stick around long enough to make some semblance of those ideas become reality.
		</p>
		<p>
			Watch this space :)
