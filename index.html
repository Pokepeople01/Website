    <h1>Welcome to here.</h1>

    <p>
		Careful stepping over all of the scaffolding. This place is a little dogshit at the moment.
		<br>I think the best way to actually make this place exist in the form I want to be in is to just start and work at it regardless of the degrees of polish of the what I'm making. So that's what I'm doing.
		<br>I'll make here into the place I really, actually want it to be somewhere along the way between now and some future time.
	</p>
	
	<p>I'll also figure out what I really want this space to be along the way. As it stands, I don't really know.</p>
